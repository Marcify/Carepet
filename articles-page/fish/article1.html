                        When caring for pet fish, diet is one of the most important aspects of your fish’s health. But
                        what do fish eat as pets, exactly?
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Do Fish Need in Their Diet?</h2>

                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="../../images/fish/article1.1.jpg" alt="Man handling food to fish pet" 
                            class="article-inline-image" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Fish require the following nutrients in their diet:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Protein</li>
                        <li>Fat</li>
                        <li>Carbohydrates</li>
                        <li>Vitamins and minerals</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Protein</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most important components in fish food is protein. Protein is needed to help support
                        a fish's:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Growth</li>
                        <li>Body tissue maintenance and repair</li>
                        <li>Immune health</li>
                        <li>Energy</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Herbivore fish need about 35-45% protein content in their food and carnivores need about 40-55%
                        protein.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fish food protein must contain all essential amino acids that the fish needs to survive. The best
                        source of protein for fish is animal protein such as fish meal. Soy is the best plant protein
                        option, but it does not contain all essential amino acids a fish needs to survive.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Fat</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fat is also required for energy, as well as hormone production and insulation. Fat should make
                        up 15–25% of your fish’s diet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fish oil is the best source of fat in fish food.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Carbohydrates and Fiber</h3>
                    <p>
                        Carbohydrates are also required for energy. Think of all the swimming fish do in a day! Carbs
                        should typically make up 25–40% of the diet for omnivore fish and less than 20% for carnivores.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Peas, beans, yeast, and nuts are great sources of carbohydrates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fiber content should typically make up less than 5% in most fish diets. Fiber is important for
                        intestinal health, motility, and inhibiting inflammation in the intestines.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Vitamins and Minerals</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pet fish, just like people, require vitamins in their diet, including vitamins A, C, D, E, and
                        K. Poor vitamin absorption in fish can lead to decreased immune function and skeletal
                        deformities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Vitamins may be listed on fish food packaging individually or as a “vitamin mix.” Minerals, on
                        the other hand, are listed on packaging as “ash.” Ash is made from the bones, scales, and shells
                        that are high in calcium and phosphorus.

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>Fish Food Pellets</h2>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="../../images/fish/article1.2.webp" alt="Fish pellet in the hand"

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Food pellets for fish are solid, compact, compressed food material that is typically cylindrical
                        in shape. They come in different varieties, such as floating or sinking pellets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pellets can maintain stable vitamins longer than fish flakes, which will lose up to 90% of their
                        vitamins within 30 seconds in water. So if your fish’s mouth is large enough to fit a pellet,
                        feed them pellets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Micro pellets are great for smaller fish and most tropical fish. Betta fish, goldfish, and koi
                        fish all eat pellets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feed your fish as much as they can consume within a two- to five-minute period.
                    </p>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>Fish Food Flakes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Flaked fish food is very thin, light, and floats on the water surface before sinking. It's fed by
                        sprinkling it on top of the tank.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fish food flakes are a good option to supplement with pellets for tropical fish. Smaller fish
                        like tetras, young goldfish, or guppies will also eat flakes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because fish can overeat—and the flakes can alter the water quality—only sprinkle enough flakes
                        that the fish can consume within two to five minutes.

                    <h2>Live, Freeze-Dried, and Frozen Fish Food</h2>
                    <p>
                        Live, freeze-dried, and frozen fish food should ideally only be fed to complement a pelleted
                        diet, and not as a sole food option unless instructed by your veterinarian. These food items are
                        not nutritionally complete for your fish. If fed alone it will lead to vitamin and mineral
                        deficiencies that can cause illnesses, decreased growth, and even death.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Live fish food</b>, like bloodworms and brine shrimp, are great for small fish, picky
                            eaters,
                            and sick fish that are not eating well. However, feeding live food to healthy fish can start
                            to make them picky and less apt to eat their balanced flakes and pelleted diet. Ideally,
                            only use live fish food as a last resort for a fish who is not eating.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Freeze-dried food</b> often contains dried krill or Daphnia, making for a crunchy treat
                            for your fish.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    This type of food is typically fed to smaller fish, like tetras or cichlids (the
                                    product
                                    packaging typically mentions which fish it’s best for, so take a look at the
                                    recommendations).
                                </li>

                                    Only offer freeze-dried or frozen treats one or two times a week if the enclosure is
                                    at the
                                    appropriate temperature of at least 65 F. Fish are unable to properly digest food in

                                    temperatures and the food could rot in their digestive system.

                    <p>
                        When looking for fish food, your veterinarian can help choose the best food, but in general it’s
                        important to feed a diet based on:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Type of fish:</b> Carnivore fish (meat eaters) require different amounts of protein than
                            herbivore fish (plant eater). Follow the guidelines of protein percentage based on the type
                            of fish you have.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Age of fish:</b> Younger fish typically need more protein while they are growing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Medical conditions:</b> If your fish is a bit overweight, for example, feeding a lower
                            carbohydrate diet can help. If you need a medicated feed for your fish, obtain a
                            prescription from your fish veterinarian. Do your research to find the best fish vet in your
                            area.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Season/temperature</b>, if your fish are outside in ponds: Do not feed pond fish if the
                            water
                            temperature is below 55 F, because the fish will be unable to metabolize and break down the
                            food at this temperature.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Your fish's food should include vitamins A, C, D, E, and K in the ingredient list. Diets that
                        have additional protein supplements like amino acids in the ingredient list can indicate a poor
                        protein source and therefore a poor-quality food.

                    <h2>How Often Should You Feed Fish?</h2>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="../../images/fish/article1.4.jpg" alt="Fish treats" 
                            class="article-inline-image" />
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Fish should be fed once or twice daily depending on the fish species.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A good rule of thumb is to feed as much food that a fish can eat within two to five minutes and
                        remove any uneaten food right away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keeping a set feeding schedule helps with your fish's circadian rhythm (wake/sleep cycle),
                        minimizes stress, and creates a time for bonding that your fish anticipates.

                        Improper feeding of fish can lead to:

                    <h3>What do goldfish eat?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Goldfish are omnivores so they eat both plants and animals. Goldfish will eat both sinking and
                        floating pellets. Goldfish with buoyancy disorders will need a sinking pelleted diet.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What do koi fish eat?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Koi fish are omnivorous and eat a maintenance pelleted diet with lower protein when pond
                        temperatures are below 65 F. They can eat a higher protein food in temperatures above 65 F.
                    <p>
                        Fish that are used for shows/breeding often have added carotenoids in their food to improve
                        bright coloration.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <ul class="key-points">
                        <li>
                            Fish require a balanced diet containing protein, fats, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and
                            minerals.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Carnivorous, omnivorous, and herbivorous fish have different protein and nutrient
                            requirements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pellets are the most nutritious and stable staple food for most pet fish.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Flakes are suitable for small fish but lose nutrients faster and can pollute water if
                            overfed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Live, frozen, and freeze-dried foods should only supplement a fish's main diet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Treats like vegetables, fruits, brine shrimp, and bloodworms can be given occasionally for
                            enrichment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fish should be fed only what they can finish within 2-5 minutes to prevent overfeeding.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Overfeeding can cause bloating, swim bladder issues, and poor water quality.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Feeding frequency depends on fish species, age, water temperature, and health needs.

                    <h2>How To Feed a Siamese</h2>
                    <p>
                       In the wild, cats hunt for small meals multiple times a day. So it may feel most natural to your cat to eat two or more small meals a day. Because Siamese cats are highly intelligent and crave something to do, food puzzles and lick mats can help banish mealtime boredom. Because they aren’t good at regulating food and calorie intake and tend to overeat, <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/nutrition/evr_ct_best_feeding_method">it’s not recommended to free-feed cats</a>.

                    <h2>How Much Should You Feed a Siamese?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Siamese cats should be fed the appropriate calories based on their age, lifestyle, and ideal body condition. Your veterinarian can help determine the right amount of food for your individual cat. If your <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_obesity">cat becomes overweight</a>, your veterinarian may recommend a change in diet such as a reduction in calories or prescription weight-management food. Hill’s® Metabolic and Royal Canin® Satiety are both great prescription weight-loss diets for cats.

                        A complete and balanced meal that meets AAFCO’s statement of nutritional adequacy will provide your cat with all essential nutrients, vitamins, fats, and proteins. In the case of health issues, your veterinarian may recommend additional nutrients.

                        to learn a little bit about these feathered friends, and what you need to know before adopting
                        one.

                    <h2>Pet Bird Species</h2>
                    <p>Birds differ remarkably across species—not only how they look, but also by the level of care they
                        require and their personalities. Some birds may be an ideal fit for your family, while others
                        aren’t a realistic option for your lifestyle. Keep in mind that these are generalities—and each
                        bird is an individual—but the information below might help you to get started on your search for
                        the ideal feathered friend for your life.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Budgerigar</h3>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="/images/bird/article5.1.avif" alt="Budgerigar" class="article-inline-image" />
                    </div>

                    <p>Also called a <a href="https://www.petmd.com/bird/budgie-care-sheet" target="_blank"
                            style="color: #3a86ff;">budgie</a> or <a
                            href="https://www.petmd.com/bird/parakeet-care-sheet" target="_blank"
                            style="color: #3a86ff;">parakeet</a>, these colorful, social little parakeets
                        are often the first bird adopted by families, particularly those with children. Budgies tend to
                        love attention, and they tame quickly when handled regularly and consistently. They are not as
                        noisy as some of the other popular bird species, but do develop a vocabulary of whistles,
                        sounds, and even words.
                    </p>

                    <p>Although all birds can bite, with regular handling, most budgies will become quite gentle. Like
                        all birds, however, they can be messy and will need daily care, attention, feeding, and
                        cleaning.
                    </p>

                    <p>Budgies are very small birds, which can make them easy targets for other household pets like dogs
                        and cats. Although they are petite, budgies do need a large cage with plenty of interesting toys
                        to explore. Budgies often thrive if allowed “free time” in the house out of the cage with family
                        but are also one of the species who can be content to stay in their cage. Just be sure they get
                        social time through the bars and the cage is large enough to provide them with amusement.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Lovebirds</h3>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="/images/bird/article5.2.avif" alt="Lovebirds" class="article-inline-image" />
                    </div>

                    <p><a href="https://www.petmd.com/bird/what-are-lovebirds" target="_blank"
                            style="color: #3a86ff;">Lovebirds</a> are one of the smaller members of the parrot
                        family, which are often common “starter” birds for new bird parents. Many people associate
                        lovebirds as coming in pairs, since they are often seen in photographs snuggled up to a
                        companion. It is certainly appropriate to get a pair of birds—but in this case, the birds
                        may choose to socialize with each other, rather than the human family. For this reason, many
                        people choose to own a single lovebird. However, if this is the case, a lone lovebird will
                        need a lot of consistent attention and socialization.
                    </p>

                    <p>Lovebirds, like all parrots, tend to be a little strong willed about their desires, and make
                        their wants and needs clearly known. This can sometimes be accompanied by a firm nip, meaning
                        that significant time needs to be invested in social interaction and training with any members
                        of the parrot family, lovebirds included.
                    </p>

                    <p>Lovebirds are comical, colorful, entertaining birds that are highly intelligent and learn tricks
                        and games quickly. Many birds develop a wide repertoire of sounds and words and enjoy learning
                        new vocal skills. Some lovebirds can be rowdy, meaning that they may not be an ideal choice in
                        apartment-type households or in homes where people need to sleep during the day. They thrive
                        with plenty of social out-of-cage interactions–typically daily.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cockatiels</h3>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="/images/bird/article5.3.avif" alt="Cockatiels"
                            class="article-inline-image" />
                    </div>

                    <p><a href="https://www.petmd.com/bird/cockatiel-care-sheet" target="_blank"
                            style="color: #3a86ff;">Cockatiels</a> are a slightly larger bird than either the
                        parakeet or the lovebird.. They are extremely popular pets, and with good reason. Social and
                        curious, cockatiels love to play with toys and entertain with whistles and chirps. Although they
                        don’t typically have a large word vocabulary, they will often “talk” back and forth with owners
                        in their own language of sounds and body language. The position of the crest of feathers on top
                        of their head can also help you to tell their mood—from straight up when alert to folded back
                        when stressed.
                    </p>

                    <p>Cockatiels are often content to spend significant amounts of time in a large cage if they get
                        interactive attention. However, they are also often good household citizens when allowed to
                        spend social time loose in the house. Take care to protect them against other household pets as
                        well as fans, open doors and windows, and hot food on the stove.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Doves</h3>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="/images/bird/article5.4.avif" alt="Doves"
                            class="article-inline-image" />
                    </div>

                    <p><a href="https://www.petmd.com/bird/dove-care-sheet" target="_blank"
                            style="color: #3a86ff;">Doves</a> are ideal pets for those that would like a “hands off”
                        bird. Although very appreciative of social interactions, doves are quickly made nervous with
                        excessive handling. Some can be hand trained, but most would like to interact at a distance and
                        on their own terms.
                    </p>

                    <p>Doves are quieter than the parrot family birds and are likely to limit their sounds to a gentle
                        cooing noise. Doves are social with people, but especially with others of their own kind, and
                        watching their interactions with each other can be fun. And, since they don’t have the powerful
                        beaks associated with the parrots, their nips are less severe.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conures</h3>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="/images/bird/article5.5.avif" alt="Conures"
                            class="article-inline-image" />
                    </div>

                    <p><a href="https://www.petmd.com/bird/small-conure-care-sheet" target="_blank"
                            style="color: #3a86ff;">Conures</a> are small to medium parrots who thrive on continual
                        interaction with their families. They are highly intelligent and curious, and always want to be
                        part of the action. They prefer to be on or with their people whenever possible—this might even
                        mean “hiding” under your shirt during snuggle time.</p>

                    <p>Conures tend to be playful, bold, and outgoing. They also have a strong bill which can deliver a
                        firm bite. Some conures also tend to be loud—as in extremely loud. These birds are not suitable
                        for life in close quarters, or for those with a low tolerance for noise. They are relatively
                        high maintenance pets but reward their families with years of loyalty and entertainment.
                    </p>

                    <h3>African Grey Parrots</h3>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="/images/bird/article5.6.avif" alt="African Grey Parrots"
                            class="article-inline-image" />
                    </div>

                    <p>These birds are medium sized parrots known for their talking and sound making ability. They are
                        both sensitive and intelligent which can easily lead to behavior problems. These birds, known as
                        the “Einsteins of the Bird World” are best kept by experienced bird enthusiasts with the time,
                        energy, and budget to provide for their needs. They are social, but are not cuddly birds. They
                        are experts at destroying toys meant for them, as well as things such as household woodwork.
                    </p>

                    <p>African grey parrots tend to be creatures of habit, and don’t thrive with changes in their habits
                        or environment and can often become one-person birds, even when regularly handled by multiple
                        people in a household. They are prone to several medical and behavioral problems, which can be
                        time consuming and expensive. But for their chosen people, these can be delightful pets capable
                        of interactive conversations that are unparalleled by other birds.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Cockatoos</h3>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="/images/bird/article5.7.avif" alt="Cockatoos"
                            class="article-inline-image" />
                    </div>

                    <p>Cockatoos are medium sized parrots which have well-earned the nicknames of “Velcro birds” because
                        of their need for constant attention from their owners. These birds are extremely affectionate
                        and often have an obsessive need to be with their owners—and not just in the same room, rather
                        to be physically with their humans. They can be very vocal and make their displeasure known from
                        across the house. However, they are also very intelligent as well as emotional.
                    </p>

                    <p>Many that have lived with cockatoos describe it just like living with a two-year-old child that
                        never grows up; these birds are capable of swinging from a total temper tantrum to absolute
                        silliness in the blink of an eye. Cockatoos have a 30+ year lifespan, meaning that pet parents
                        need to be prepared to have a long-term commitment with these needy feathered friends.

                    <h2>What Is the Best Bird To Get as a Pet?</h2>
                    <p>The “best bird” will depend on your family lifestyle. All birds will require daily attention,
                        feeding, and cleaning, as well as a commitment to “bird proofing” both your house and your
                        lifestyle. How much time and effort you are able to commit to your new feathered companion
                        should help guide your choice of a bird.</p>

                    <h2>What Is the Easiest Pet Bird to Tame?</h2>
                    <p>Taming a bird will depend somewhat on the bird’s background. Young birds, as a rule, are easier
                        to tame than older birds. Those that have been hand reared will invariably be easier to work
                        with than those that are not, meaning birds purchased through pet store bird mills are likely to
                        be much harder to handle. Meeting a bird through a bird shelter or rescue should help you
                        determine how their level of tameness and their personality.</p>

                    <h2>What Is the Gentlest Pet Bird?</h2>
                    <p>The most gentle pet bird is the one that you started working with at a young age and consistently
                        worked with and tamed. All birds are capable of biting, and the bills of the parrots in
                        particular can deliver a very firm bite; even the smaller parrots can provide a very painful
                        bite. Working and playing with your bird every day is the most reliable way to make your bird
                        gentle.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>What Pet Bird is Low Maintenance?</h2>
                    <p>Birds, on average, are not low-maintenance pets. Despite the fact that bird stores sell bags of
                        “birdseed” for the vast majority of species, this is not an appropriate diet. Purchasing and
                        feeding the appropriate food for your species of bird, buying an appropriate cage and toys,
                        keeping things clean, and spending social time all adds up to significantly more time and
                        expense than that required by an average cat or dog.</p>
                    <p>Birds also require specialized veterinary care, meaning that your corner veterinarian is unlikely
                        to be comfortable working with them and that you may need to travel for the birds’ medical
                        needs. Many of the pet bird species also have a life expectancy of more than 20 years. This all
                        translates to the fact that the decision to getting a pet bird is a significant investment of
                        time and money. Some of the shorter lived and cage content species are likely to be considered
                        the “lowest maintenance,” so owners looking for an avian companion that requires care on the
                        level of a dog or cat might want to consider something along the lines of a budgie, cockatiel,
                        or dove.</p>

                    <p>Generally, the most loyal pet bird is the one you have spent time, energy, and love hand taming!
                        Although birds may ultimately choose their “person”, all birds respond positively to gentle
                        handling and positive reinforcement.</p>

                        <li>Best depends heavily on your lifestyle, time, environment, and commitment. What works for
                            one person may not work for another.</li>
                        <li>Birds require daily care: feeding, cleaning, social interaction, and habitat maintenance.
                            They’re usually more work than typical pets.</li>
                        <li>Some species are better for beginners (e.g. budgies, cockatiels, doves), while others —
                            especially parrots — demand more experience, attention, and resources.</li>
                        <li>Even “gentle” birds may bite; gentle handling and consistent socialization from a young age
                            help — especially when taming them.</li>
                        <li>Birds often live many years, so getting one is a long-term commitment.</li>

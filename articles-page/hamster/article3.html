                        If your hamster's nails are overgrown so that they are folding inwards or curling sideways, they likely need to be trimmed. If you are not comfortable with trimming the hamster’s nails, then you should take him to the vet to have them trimmed. However, if your hamster is very comfortable and calm with you, and will allow you to hold him in one hand, then you can do this on your own.

                        If your hamster is not tame enough to be handled, you will need to tame him before you can even think about trimming his nails.

                      <li>
                        Be patient when working with your hamster. Remember that it will take time for him to get use to you, and to being handled. If you lose your patience, it will frighten him, prolonging the process even more.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If your hamster badly needs his nails trimmed, but is too wild to be handled, take him to your vet where they can use a sedative to take care of the nails.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Have plenty of treats ready during the taming process, too!

                    <h2>Practice holding your hamster in the “nail-trimming” position</h2>

                    <p>
                        Once your hamster is tame, and doesn’t mind when you hold him in your hand, spend a few minutes each day holding him in the position you will hold him in when trimming his nails.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        There is no right way to hold your hamster when trimming his nails. Find a way that is comfortable for both you and your hamster. You can try holding him upright in your hand so that his paws stick out above your fingers, or try holding him flat, so that you will be able to grasp his his paw between your fingers.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Don’t hold on to his paws when first practicing this position. Get him comfortable with it before moving on to that.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Give him a treat to reward him when he sits still in your hand.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        After practicing for a few times, you might also consider wrapping him in a small towel to keep him more contained, if you think it is necessary. If he sits very still in your hand, it may not be necessary.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">

                    <p>
                        Once your hamster is comfortable sitting in the nail-trimming position, spend time each day holding each of his paws between your fingers. Begin with a very gentle grasp, and when he becomes more comfortable (e.g. doesn’t try to jerk his paw out of your fingers) begin to grasp a bit more firmly. You want your grasp to be firm but gentle when you trim the nails.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Remember to reward him after each training session! Either with a treat or some time spent running around in his ball, if he has one.
                      </li>

                    <p>
                        Once your hamster will allow you to grasp his paws, take time to examine them carefully. It is critical that you understand where the quick is. If you trim the quick, it will bleed and be very painful for your hamster. If you do trim the quick it is unlikely he will let you trim them again.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Most hamsters have nails that are translucent, so when you look very carefully, you will see a part that is nearly clear, but closer to where his nail meets his paw, there will be a more cloudy part; this is the quick.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The quick is the area where the blood supply to the nails ends.
                      </li>

                    <p>
                        This is why it is important that you have a bright light (or that you sit in bright sunlight). Hamsters nails are usually translucent, and with brighter light you will be able to see the quick. You should absolutely not cut this! If you do, it will be painful for your hamster and the nail will bleed.
                    </p>

                        Make sure that you are trimming only the nail, and not the quick! Clip the nail. Your hamster may squirm at the point if he feels frightened. Offer him a treat, if necessary.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        On some days, your hamster may be too squirmy to trim more than one or two nails. If this is the case, don’t try to force him. Simply trim the nail that is the longest, and try again tomorrow.
                      </li>

                    <p>
                        If you were successful with the first nail, and your hamster is still calm and still in your hand, proceed to the next nail. You should only continue to trim the nails for as long as your hamster will sit still.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        If he gets impatient and squirmy, either take a break for a few hours or try again tomorrow.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        You should also try to choose a time of day where your hamster is least active. Hamsters are nocturnal animals, so they will be less active during the day.
                      </li>

                        Once you are finished with the nail trimming session, reward your hamster with a treat. Although nail trimming will not usually be a pleasant experience for either of you, if you consistently reward him with treats, he will learn to associate nail trimming with something good.

                            When taming or training your hamster, limit your sessions to 10-15 minutes each day maximum. Training can be a stressful experience for your hamster so you should try to limit the amount of time. If he becomes too stressed, the taming/training process will be prolonged.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place a rock that is large enough for your hamster to walk in inside the cage. This way, he will walk on it, and his nails will be filed down by the rock. You can sterilize the rock by boiling it in water before placing it in the cage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Only trim your hamsters nails completely when necessary!

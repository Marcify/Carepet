                        Shih Tzu love to be spoiled with attention and treats; they love to please their 
                        pet parents and are usually quick to learn new tricks to get the reward and praise they crave.

                    <h2>How To Train A Shih Tzu Puppy</h2>

                    <p>
                        Shih Tzu are people pleasers and are usually easy to train. They need high-reward 
                        treats and positive reinforcement when training for the best results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just make sure to count how many calories your pup is getting from treats—these 
                        can add up fast in a small breed like the Shih Tzu and lead to extra weight.

                    <h2>Do Shih Tzu Bark A Lot?</h2>

                    <p>
                        The Shih Tzu temperament is influenced by their origins as “alert dogs,” 
                        and they will still bark to alert that someone or something new is coming 
                        into their environment all these centuries later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They can also be curious and dig if left unattended, so it's important to monitor 
                        them closely in new or outdoor environments. 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Neighborhood walks</li>
                        <li>Backyard  or indoor playtime</li>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <ul class="key-points">
                        <li>
                            Shih Tzu love attention and treats, making them eager to please their pet parents and naturally quick 
                            learners who will readily perform new tricks to receive rewards and praise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shih Tzu are people pleasers and typically easy to train when using high-reward treats and positive 
                            reinforcement methods to achieve the best training results.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Training treat calories must be carefully monitored in Shih Tzu, as even small amounts can quickly add up 
                            in this small breed and lead to unhealthy weight gain.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Due to their origins as "alert dogs," Shih Tzu bark frequently to announce when someone or something 
                            new enters their environment, a behavior that persists centuries after their original breeding purpose.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shih Tzu can be curious and may dig when left unattended, requiring close supervision in new or outdoor 
                            environments, though they enjoy low-key activities like neighborhood walks, playtime, learning tricks, and cuddling.
                        </li>

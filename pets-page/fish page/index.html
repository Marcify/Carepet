        <h4>How to Properly Feed Your Fish</h4>
        <p>
          New aquarists often wonder what, how much, and how often to feed their fish, but the answers depend on the
          species' natural diet. Herbivorous fish eat frequently throughout the day, while carnivorous fish eat less
          often, similar to their hunting patterns in the wild. Omnivorous fish have the most flexible diet and readily
          accept food whenever it's offered, since in nature they may not know when their next meal.

          fish are difficult or time-consuming to train, but this could not be further from the truth! Most fish love to
          play “the training game” and will surprise you with how smart and playful they can be. While still unfamiliar
          to many people, fish training is a great way to spend time with your fish and provide a creative new source of
          enrichment for your pet in just five or ten minutes a day.

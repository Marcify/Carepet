                        Chihuahuas are prone to obesity, so it's important to feed them a 
                        well-balanced diet and to exercise them daily. Adult Chihuahuas should 
                        be fed a restricted-calorie diet if weight gain is noticed. Otherwise, 
                        a twice-daily, balanced adult small bite diet is recommended.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feeding your Chihuahua dry kibble is recommended to lessen the risk 
                        of periodontal disease. That's because dry kibble is abrasive on the teeth 
                        and can remove some plaque buildup. Make sure to monitor your Chi's treats 
                        and snacks as well—even a few calories can add up in a toy breed.

                    <h2>How To Feed A Chihuahua</h2>

                    <p>
                        Chihuahua puppies should be fed frequent meals—about three or four daily—to 
                        avoid hypoglycemia, depending on veterinary recommendations. High fat, protein, 
                        and complex carbohydrate-heavy meals will lessen the risk of low blood sugar 
                        issues, too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feeding your Chi from a raised dog bowl can help older dogs with a collapsing 
                        trachea. If your pup lowers her head to eat, this can lead to closing of the 
                        airway and can induce coughing.

                    <h2>How Much Should You Feed A Chihuahua</h2>

                    <p>
                        Your veterinarian can help you calculate the daily calories your pet should 
                        eat to avoid weight gain. When choosing a diet for your Chihuahua, choose a 
                        small-breed food to allow easy chewing. These formulated diets will also have 
                        recommendations for serving sizes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because every dog is different, it's important to monitor for weight gain, 
                        weight loss, and muscle loss to determine if more or less food should be offered.

                    <h2>Nutritional Tips For Chihuahuas</h2>

                    <p>
                        Supplements that may support the health of this breed include omega 
                        fatty acids, which are good for your dog's heart, brain, skin, and joints. 
                        Dental chews and supplements may also be recommended by your veterinary 
                        team to lessen the risk of periodontal disease.

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <ul class="key-points">
                        <li>
                            Chihuahuas are prone to obesity and require a well-balanced, restricted-calorie diet with daily 
                            exercise to maintain a healthy weight, as even small treats can significantly impact toy breeds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Dry kibble is recommended over wet food for Chihuahuas because its abrasive texture helps remove 
                            plaque buildup and reduces the risk of periodontal disease, which is common in this breed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Chihuahua puppies need three to four meals daily with high-fat, high-protein, and complex carbohydrate 
                            content to prevent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), a serious risk in toy breeds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using raised dog bowls can help older Chihuahuas with collapsing trachea by preventing airway 
                            compression and coughing that occurs when they lower their heads to eat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Choose small-breed formulated food for easy chewing, consult your veterinarian for proper calorie 
                            calculations, and consider supplements like omega fatty acids for heart and joint health plus dental 
                            chews to prevent periodontal disease.
                        </li>

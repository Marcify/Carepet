                        The average Golden Retriever lifespan is 10-12 years, and they're typically healthy dogs. 
                        However, due to poor breeding, some Golden Retrievers may develop a handful of health issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can gain more insight into your Golden's health by screening them for over 230 genetic 
                        health risks with a dog DNA test.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Make sure to do your research when looking to adopt a Golden Retriever or find a reputable 
                        Golden Retriever breeder so medical issues are less likely in your puppy.

                    <h2>Hot Spots</h2>

                    <p>
                        Hot spots on dogs are localized areas of skin that are inflamed and infected, 
                        most often with bacteria and/or yeast. Hot spots develop more often in dogs 
                        that excessively scratch, chew, and lick—behaviors associated with underlying allergies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In allergic dogs, the healthy skin barrier is compromised, so as the normal microbes 
                        on the skin multiply abnormally, the skin becomes inflamed and infected. A hot spot 
                        usually develops quickly and can lead to hair loss, redness, and moist raw skin 
                        that may ooze, crust, or develop thick scabs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you notice any signs of hot spots in your Golden, take them to a veterinarian. 
                        Hot spots typically resolve quickly with medication to treat the infection and, 
                        most importantly, with management of the underlying cause.

                    <h2>Atopic Dermatitis (Atopy)</h2>

                    <p>
                        Atopic dermatitis (atopy) is an inflammatory and itchy skin and ear condition 
                        Golden Retrievers are predisposed to. It's triggered by environmental allergens, 
                        such pollen, grass, dust mites, dander, and mold.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Symptoms usually develop between 2-6 years of age, so regular veterinary visits 
                        are important to monitor your dog's skin health.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Golden Retrievers with atopy are often scratching, chewing, or licking themselves. 
                        This can lead to hair loss, thickened skin, ear infections, or a rash on your dog.

                    <h2>Hypothyroidism</h2>

                    <p>
                        Hypothyroidism is an endocrine disorder that happens when the thyroid gland loses 
                        its ability to produce thyroid hormones, leading to symptoms such as:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Unexplained weight gain</li>
                            <li>Decreased energy level</li>
                            <li>Recurring ear and skin infections</li>
                            <li>Thinning fur</li>
                            <li>Dry, scaly skin</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Golden Retrievers are predisposed to hypothyroidism and typically develop symptoms 
                        when they are middle-aged. This condition can be managed with lifelong medication.

                    <h2>Hip Dysplasia</h2>

                    <p>
                        Hip dysplasia is an inherited condition where the hip joint is deformed, due to the 
                        ball (head of the thighbone) and socket (in the pelvis) not properly aligning. 
                        This can occur in one or both hip joints, causing pain and arthritis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Symptoms include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lameness</li>
                            <li>Slowness to rise from a lying position</li>
                            <li>"Bunny-hopping" gait when running</li>
                            <li>Reluctance to run, jump, or go up or down stairs</li>
                            <li>Holding the affected leg out to the side when sitting up</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reputable Golden Retriever breeders make sure their dogs are screened for this genetic condition, 
                        so it's best to purchase a Golden Retriever puppy from a breeder that has had their dogs 
                        certified with a PennHIP evaluation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hip dysplasia can be managed with weight management, diet changes, exercise, joint supplements, 
                        and certain medications. But in serious cases, surgery may be needed.

                    <p>
                        Elbow dysplasia encompasses several different inherited orthopedic conditions that ultimately 
                        lead to degenerative joint disease (DJD) within the elbow. X-rays or CT scans are used to 
                        diagnose elbow dysplasia, and the condition is treated with a joint injection performed 
                        by specialist (Synovetin OA®), surgery, joint supplements, and/or anti-inflammatory and 
                        pain medications.

                    <h2>Eye Conditions</h2>

                    <p>
                        Golden Retrievers are prone to certain eye conditions, including:
                        <ul>

                                An inherited eye condition where brown or black cysts develop on the eye. 
                                They are usually benign and develop when a Golden is at least 5 years old. 
                                Treatment usually includes eye or oral medications. Over time, pigmentary 
                                uveitis can cause cataracts and glaucoma.

                    <p>
                        Goldens can develop a few types of canine cancer as well. Some common cancers include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/cancer/c_dg_lymphoma" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff; font-weight: bold;">Lymphoma</a>: 
                                A type of cancer that originates in the lymph nodes and typically spreads to 
                                other organs. Lymph nodes that commonly enlarge with lymphoma are on the neck, 
                                behind the knee, and inside the thigh. There is a relatively high prevalence 
                                of this condition within the Golden Retriever breed.

                                or heart in Golden Retrievers. This type of cancer forms a blood-filled tumor 
                                that can rupture at any time and cause a dog to bleed internally. A ruptured 
                                tumor can be life-threatening if not treated immediately.

                        is a genetic heart condition that Golden Retriever puppies inherit from their parents. 
                        Responsible breeding is key to ensuring prevention of this condition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SAS occurs when fibrous tissue slowly forms in the heart and causes an obstruction 
                        of blood flow. Over time, this condition causes the heart to stop functioning 
                        properly, resulting in heart damage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Golden Retriever puppies and dogs with SAS often have a heart murmur that 
                        can be heard by your veterinarian during a routine physical exam. Dogs 
                        with mild to moderate SAS may not show any symptoms. However, Goldens 
                        with severe SAS are lethargic, tired after short periods of exercise, 
                        may collapse, and can die suddenly.

                            Golden Retrievers have a 10-12 year lifespan and are generally healthy, but poor breeding practices 
                            can lead to various genetic health issues, making it essential to research reputable breeders thoroughly.

                            Skin conditions including hot spots and atopic dermatitis are common in Golden Retrievers, often triggered 
                            by environmental allergens and excessive scratching, requiring veterinary management of underlying causes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Golden Retrievers are predisposed to hypothyroidism and joint problems including hip and elbow dysplasia, 
                            which can be managed with weight control, supplements, and medications, though severe cases may require surgery.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Eye conditions like pigmentary uveitis and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) affect Golden Retrievers, 
                            potentially leading to cataracts, glaucoma, and blindness, though blind dogs can still live quality lives.

                        <li>
                            Golden Retrievers face higher cancer risks including lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma (aggressive spleen/liver/heart

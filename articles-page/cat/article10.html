                       Siamese <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/care/how-long-do-cats-live">cats have an impressive lifespan</a>, averaging 15 years but known to live well into their 20s. Because they’re prone to some health conditions, it’s a good idea to <a href="https://www.petmd.com/general-health/pet-insurance-worth-it">consider purchasing pet insurance</a> for your Siamese kitten.

                    <h2>Pica</h2>
                    <p>
                       <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_coprophagia_and_pica">Pica</a> in cats is the tendency to eat non-food items and may be a form of compulsive behavior. According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1558787815001215">study published in the Journal of Veterinary Behavior</a>, Asian cat breeds such as the Siamese are prone to pica—especially wool-sucking. Ingesting hair ties and strings is also very common and can be very serious. If your cat eats something inappropriate or stops eating their regular meals, speak with your veterinarian. Eating non-food items could result in poisoning or <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_gastrointestinal_obstruction">internal obstructions</a>, which can be life-threatening.

                        <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/cat-asthma">Cat asthma</a>, like human asthma, includes symptoms such as <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_cough">coughing</a>, difficulty breathing, and wheezing. While reducing dust, dander, and candles, and using special cat litter may relieve symptoms for some cats, cats with severe feline asthma <a href="https://www.petmd.com/care/how-to-give-pets-an-inhaler">may require an inhaler</a> or lifelong oral medications.

                    <h2>Amyloidosis</h2>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/systemic/amyloidosis-cats">Amyloidosis</a> refers to a group of diseases caused by abnormal deposition of the fibrous protein amyloid into various tissues of the body. Amyloidosis disrupts the normal functions of these areas, and can lead to conditions such as <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hepatic_failure_acute">liver failure</a> and <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/kidney-disease-cats">kidney disease</a>. Siamese cats are believed to have a genetic mutation that increases their vulnerability to amyloidosis.

                    <h2>Hereditary Retinal Degeneration</h2>
                    <p>
                        While more frequently reported in <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/breeds/c_ct_abyssinian">Abyssinian</a> and <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/breeds/c_ct_somali">Somali cats</a>, Siamese cats may be prone to <a href="https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO201513265527221.pdf">genetic degeneration of the retina</a>. Symptoms typically begin to appear in young cats around 1 or 2 years of age, first with night blindness and progressing to total loss of vision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the condition cannot be cured, cats without vision can live a full life with special considerations. Responsible Siamese breeders can and should genetically test parents for the genes.

                    <h2>Dental Disease</h2>
                    <p>
                        As with all cats, Siamese can develop <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/dental-issues-cats">dental disease</a>. Brushing your cat’s teeth at home with a cat-safe toothpaste is the best way to prevent dental disease. Your veterinarian will examine your cat’s teeth yearly at their wellness exam and will recommend a dental cleaning under anesthesia when necessary.

                        <li>
                            Pica Risk: Siamese cats often chew or eat non-food items (like wool or strings), which can cause poisoning or dangerous gut blockages.

                        <li>
                            Asthma Prone: They may develop feline asthma, leading to coughing and breathing difficulty; severe cases need inhalers or long-term meds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Genetic Disorders: Siamese cats are susceptible to amyloidosis (affecting organs like liver/kidneys) and hereditary retinal degeneration, which can progress to blindness.

                        <li>
                            Dental Disease: Regular tooth brushing and veterinary dental care are important to prevent common dental problems.

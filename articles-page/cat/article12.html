                    <h2>Siamese Cat Personality and Temperament</h2>
                    <p>
                       Siamese cats have a reputation for being spunky and talkative. But of course, every cat is different, says Louviere. Siamese cats can make wonderful additions for households seeking an affectionate feline with a vibrant personality, including those with kids and pups. As with any cat, introductions to other cats, dogs, and kids should be done slowly and with care.

                    <h2>Siamese Behavior</h2>
                    <p>
                       Early socialization is essential for any friendly feline, but Siamese cats particularly thrive with affection and attention. Although they often develop a close bond with their favorite human, don’t be surprised if you find them on your houseguest’s lap. When they’re feeling left out or just want to chat, <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/general-health/cat-noises">Siamese cats will loudly meow, chip, or trill.</a>

                    <h2>Siamese Training</h2>
                    <p>
                        Siamese cats are known as gentle beings, so they respond best to positive reinforcement training. They’re wicked smart and always up for engaging activities alongside their human, making them ideal candidates for <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/training/evr_ct_how-to-take-your-cat-for-a-walk">harness and leash training</a>, high fives, and other training tricks.

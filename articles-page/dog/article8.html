                        Chihuahuas can be a dedicated lap dog, a sassy ball of energy, or both. 
                        In fact, the official breed standard describes Chis as having a “saucy expression.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chihuahuas are loyal, playful, energetic dogs who often think they are larger 
                        than they actually are. They range from being bold and curious to being 
                        quite shy and timid, but they are typically bright and loving with their 
                        family. They can have some social anxiety around new people and animals 
                        and are known to bark at others when introduced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They are great around children and other pets if introduced properly in a 
                        controlled environment. But due to their small size, it's important that 
                        children are monitored closely when playing with these dogs to avoid accidental injury.

                    <h2>Chihuahua Behavior</h2>

                    <p>
                        The Chihuahua's small size makes them easy to take everywhere, which can be a 
                        blessing and a curse. Because these dogs are often carried around and go 
                        lots of places, they can easily develop separation anxiety.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having a safe space for your Chihuahua at home, such as a small dog crate, 
                        and giving them plenty of toys can be helpful to avoid this stress. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though small in stature, Chihuahuas are high-energy dogs and require lots 
                        of playtime and activity. Daily exercise with walks and indoor playtime 
                        helps maintain their physical and mental health.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>Chihuahua Training</h2>

                    <p>
                        Chihuahuas are often easy to train because they are smart and want to 
                        please their pet parents. That said, they can also be strong-willed 
                        due to their high intelligence, and they need a patient trainer who 
                        uses positive reinforcement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This strong-willed nature can also make house training more difficult 
                        with a Chihuahua than with other breeds. Food rewards are recommended 
                        (and are enthusiastically welcomed!) when learning and training—but 
                        stay mindful of calories!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When bringing home a Chihuahua puppy, immediately begin socializing 
                        them by exposing them to new people, animals, and situations. This 
                        will help your little dog grow to be calm and confident throughout 
                        their long life.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <ul class="key-points">
                        <li>
                            Chihuahuas are loyal, energetic, and playful dogs with a "saucy expression" who range from bold 
                            and curious to shy and timid, but typically form strong bonds with their families despite their small size.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Due to their portability and tendency to be carried everywhere, Chihuahuas can easily develop separation 
                            anxiety, making it important to provide a safe space like a crate and plenty of toys for independent time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Despite their tiny stature, Chihuahuas are high-energy dogs requiring daily exercise through walks and 
                            indoor playtime to maintain both their physical and mental health.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Chihuahuas are intelligent and eager to please, making them relatively easy to train, but their strong-willed 
                            nature requires patient trainers using positive reinforcement, especially during house training which can be challenging.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Early socialization is critical for Chihuahua puppies to help them become calm and confident adults, as they 
                            can have social anxiety around new people and animals and are known to bark when introduced to strangers.
                        </li>

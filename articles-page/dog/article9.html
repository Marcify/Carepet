                        Grooming isn't much of a hassle with Chihuahuas. But note that it's easy for 
                        Chihuahuas to get cold—again, they are so small. But because of this, they're 
                        often happy to be put in doggy sweaters, wrapped up in warm blankets, and 
                        dressed in coats to stabilize their body temperature.

                    <h2>Coat Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        Chihuahua dogs can have a short or long coat in a wide range of colors 
                        including black, white, and brown. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Short-haired Chihuahuas should be brushed about once a week to help control 
                        their moderate shedding. Long-haired Chihuahuas require more frequent 
                        brushing—about two or three times weekly—along with routine de-shedding 
                        of the undercoat. They might need a bath once or twice a month, depending 
                        on how active they are outdoors.

                    <h2>Eye Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        A Chihuahua's ears are pricked, meaning they stand at attention. 
                        This lets oxygen enter them easily, making Chihuahuas less prone 
                        to moisture and ear infections than dogs with floppy ears. 
                        Because of this, you probably won't need to clean their ears 
                        very often, if at all.

                    <p>
                        The biggest part of their upkeep will be their teeth, which need to be 
                        brushed daily to prevent dental disease.

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <ul class="key-points">
                        <li>
                            Chihuahua grooming is relatively low-maintenance, though their tiny size makes them prone to getting cold, 
                            so they often benefit from wearing sweaters, coats, and being wrapped in blankets to maintain body temperature.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Short-haired Chihuahuas require weekly brushing to manage moderate shedding, while long-haired varieties 
                            need more frequent brushing two to three times weekly plus routine de-shedding of their undercoat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Chihuahuas typically need bathing once or twice a month depending on their outdoor activity level, with 
                            coat colors ranging widely from black, white, and brown combinations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Their pricked (upright) ears allow oxygen to enter easily, making Chihuahuas less susceptible to moisture 
                            and ear infections than floppy-eared breeds, so ear cleaning is rarely necessary.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Daily teeth brushing is the most critical aspect of Chihuahua grooming to prevent dental disease, which 
                            is extremely common in this breed due to their small mouths and overcrowded teeth.
                        </li>

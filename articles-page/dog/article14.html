                        The average Shih Tzu lifespan is long, at 10-18 years. They are considered a healthy 
                        breed overall, though they can be prone to certain medical conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's important to know that Shih Tzu are brachycephalic, meaning they have a short, 
                        squished muzzle. This can put them at a higher risk for overheating or heatstroke, 
                        so they need to stay out of the hot summer weather.
                    </p>

                        Some medical problems this breed is predisposed to include:

                    <h2>Brachycephalic Syndrome</h2>

                    <p>
                        Dogs with flat faces, such as the Shih Tzu, have brachycephalic syndrome. 
                        This is characterized by upper airway abnormalities such as:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Small nostrils</li>
                            <li>A long, soft palate</li>
                            <li>Collapsing trachea</li>
                            <li>Extra tissue in the back of the throat</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of these aspects can cause trouble breathing and make Shih Tzu more prone to overheating. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the condition is severe, your veterinarian may discuss surgery to help correct 
                        some of these issues when your Shih Tzu is a puppy before they have trouble breathing.

                    <h2>Obesity</h2>

                    <p>
                        Shih Tzu aren't exactly athletes—and because of this, they can often become overweight. 
                        Obesity in dogs can lead to other issues such as diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, 
                        and difficulty breathing. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's important to limit treats to less than 10% of a dog's daily calorie intake and 
                        ensure your pup gets 20-30 minutes of controlled exercise (such as walks and playtime) daily.

                    <h2>Luxating Patella</h2>

                    <p>
                        Patellar luxation is a condition where the kneecap slips out of its normal position, 
                        causing discomfort, limping, and arthritis. Dogs with luxating patellas will occasionally 
                        skip and hold up a back leg during walking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often, the patella will return to its correct position on its own, but sometimes 
                        surgery is recommended in severe cases.

                    <h2>Periodontal Disease</h2>

                    <p>
                        Periodontal disease, or dental disease, is commonly seen in Shih Tzu dogs because 
                        their teeth can easily overcrowd their small mouths. This overcrowding leads to 
                        tartar and plaque development. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Routine teeth brushing, professional dental cleanings, and surgical removal of any 
                        problematic teeth will help keep your Shih Tzu's mouth healthy.

                    <h2>Hip Dysplasia</h2>

                    <p>
                        Hip dysplasia results when the hip joints don't develop properly. This eventually 
                        leads to arthritis, trouble walking, and pain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hip dysplasia is often diagnosed via X-rays and treated with medication or joint 
                        supplements to reduce inflammation and pain. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary.

                    <h2>Eye Problems</h2>

                    <p>
                        Shih Tzu have many inherited eye conditions, including glaucoma, chronic dry eye, 
                        and cataracts. Eye conditions can be quite painful, and signs include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Red eyes</li>

                            <li>Eye discharge</li>
                            <li>Rubbing the eyes</li>
                            <li>Cloudy eyes</li>
                            <li>Squinting</li>
                            <li>Blindness</li>

                        Contact a veterinarian if you have any concerns about your dog's eyes.

                    <h2>Liver Shunts (Portosystemic Shunts)</h2>

                    <p>
                        A liver shunt is a liver disease that causes toxins in the blood stream to bypass the liver, 
                        the organ that normally filters these toxins out of the body. The toxins build up, eventually 
                        causing chronic gastrointestinal issues, stunted growth, and even neurologic signs such 
                        as ataxia (a “drunken sailor gait”) or seizures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blood testing is performed to diagnose this condition, along with abdominal imaging and, 
                        often, surgery to repair the shunt, if possible. Diet changes and oral medications can 
                        also be used to manage dogs with milder signs.

                    <h2>Ear Infections</h2>

                    <p>
                        Shih Tzu ears are floppy, which presents two issues:
                        <ul>
                            <li>It does not allow air flow into the ear canals</li>
                            <li>It allows fur to grow inside of their ears</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This combination can trap moisture in the ears, leading to red, painful, and/or itchy ears.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your veterinarian will assess for ear infections in your Shih Tzu with a thorough examination. 
                        Infections are often treated with topical and/or oral medications.

                    <h2>Kidney Issues</h2>

                    <p>
                        Glomerulonephrititis is a type of kidney disease inherited in Shih Tzu. It causes excess 
                        protein to be lost from the body and may cause the kidneys to malfunction at an early age. 
                        Clinical signs can include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lack of appetite</li>
                            <li>Vomiting</li>
                            <li>Diarrhea</li>
                            <li>Increased thirst and urination</li>
                            <li>Weight loss</li>

                    <p>
                        Therapy with diet changes, oral medications, and sometimes fluid therapy is required for treatment.

                    <ul class="key-points">
                        <li>
                            Shih Tzu have a long lifespan of 10-18 years but are brachycephalic (flat-faced) dogs with upper airway 
                            abnormalities that make them prone to overheating and breathing difficulties, requiring avoidance of hot weather.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Obesity is common in Shih Tzu due to their low activity levels, leading to complications like diabetes, arthritis, 
                            and heart disease, making treat limitation and 20-30 minutes of daily exercise essential.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Dental disease is prevalent in Shih Tzu because their small mouths cause tooth overcrowding and plaque buildup, 
                            requiring routine brushing, professional cleanings, and potential tooth extractions to maintain oral health.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Joint issues including luxating patellas and hip dysplasia cause discomfort and arthritis in Shih Tzu, managed 
                            with medications and supplements in mild cases, but potentially requiring surgery in severe situations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shih Tzu face multiple inherited conditions including eye problems (glaucoma, cataracts, dry eye), liver shunts 
                            causing toxin buildup, ear infections from floppy ears trapping moisture, and kidney disease (glomerulonephritis) 
                            requiring specialized veterinary care and treatment.
                        </li>

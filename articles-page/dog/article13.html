                        Grooming a Golden Retriever is an important part of their care, as these dogs have 
                        thick coats and sensitive skin. Their eyes and ears can require special attention, too.

                    <h2>Skin Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        Regularly checking your Golden Retriever's skin can help you detect hot spots or other 
                        issues that develop. If you notice an increase in scratching, chewing, or licking, 
                        talk to your veterinarian.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because Goldens are prone to atopy (environmental allergies), regular baths with gentle, 
                        hypoallergenic shampoo can help reduce exposure to allergens and help keep their skin 
                        free from infection.

                    <h2>Coat Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        Golden Retrievers have a dense double coat, so they shed a lot. It's important to 
                        brush your dog at least once or twice every week to reduce shedding and prevent 
                        matting, especially behind the ears and on the hind limbs.
                    </p>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>Eye Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        Golden Retrievers sometimes have a mild amount of clear or brown tear staining. 
                        You can use a vet-approved tear stain remover to clean off any discharge that accumulates.

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>Ear Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        Golden Retrievers are prone to ear infections because of the skin and ear inflammation 
                        associated with underlying allergies and, less commonly, due to hypothyroidism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To minimize the risk of ear infections in Golden Retrievers, it's best to clean their 
                        ears with a product that contains a drying agent (like <a href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/condition/progressive-retinal-atrophy-in-dogs" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">Epi-Otic® Advanced</a>) 
                        every two to three weeks for maintenance, plus after swimming or bathing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ask your veterinarian how often your dog's ears should be cleaned.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="key-points">
                        <li>
                            Grooming is essential for Golden Retrievers due to their thick double coats and sensitive skin, with special 
                            attention needed for their eyes and ears to maintain overall health and comfort.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Regular skin checks help detect hot spots and other issues early, while frequent baths with gentle, hypoallergenic 
                            shampoo reduce allergen exposure since Golden Retrievers are prone to environmental allergies (atopy).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Golden Retrievers shed heavily due to their dense double coat, requiring brushing at least once or twice weekly 
                            to reduce shedding and prevent matting, especially behind the ears and on the hind limbs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mild clear or brown tear staining is common in Golden Retrievers and can be managed with vet-approved tear 
                            stain removers to clean accumulated discharge around the eyes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Golden Retrievers are prone to ear infections due to underlying allergies and hypothyroidism, requiring ear 
                            cleaning with drying agents every two to three weeks plus after swimming or bathing to minimize infection risk.

                        Dogs are often called loyal companions, and they have earned this 
                        reputation for good reason. They bring joy, comfort, and companionship 
                        to millions of families worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a pet parent, you must keep an eye on the signs of stubborn and disobedient 
                        behavior. Addressing them proactively is the secret to raising a well-mannered 
                        and calm pet.

                    <h2>Leash Pulling</h2>
                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/expert-tips-dog-leash-issues/" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">American Kennel Club</a> 
                        highlights the importance of keeping your dog on a leash, 
                        particularly in public areas. It keeps people safe and ensures that you are on the 
                        right side of the law. However, leash pulling can be a hard thing to handle for dog 
                        parents, and it usually happens when your dog is stubborn or disobedient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine your pet walking calmly by your side, and suddenly it drags you forward, 
                        chases distractions, or runs in circles. Leash pulling is frustrating for owners and 
                        creates safety risks, especially near traffic or in crowded areas. It may steam from 
                        excitement or a lack of leash training. A stubborn dog may resist walking at your pace, 
                        preferring instead to lead the pack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This behavior should not be overlooked as it is a subtle dominance trait. Training can 
                        help reduce leash pulling. Consistent use of commands and rewarding calm walking with 
                        treats or praise helps signal that pulling will not be rewarded.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Ignoring Commands</h2>
                    <p>
                        You may have noticed that dog feeding guides tell you how much dog food 
                        to feed per day. But most dogs shouldn't have just one meal a day, so 
                        you'll have to divide the amount of food on the feeding chart by the number 
                        of meals your dog eats daily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To determine a dog feeding schedule, start with the below recommendations, 
                        which vary based on a dog's size and age:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Large and giant breeds:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For puppies up to 4 months of age: three (3) meals per day</li>
                                <li>For adults and seniors: two (2) to three (3) meals per day</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Small and medium breeds:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For puppies up to 4 months of age: three (3) meals per day</li>
                                <li>For adults and seniors: two (2) meals per day</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Toy breeds:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For puppies up to 4 months of age: four (4) to five (5) meals per day</li>
                                <li>For puppies 4-6 months of age: three (3) meals per day</li>
                                <li>For dogs 6 months of age and older: two (2) meals per day</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <h2>Why It's Important To Feed Your Dog The Right Amount</h2>
                    <p>
                        Feeding dogs correctly matters! Underfeeding can lead to low energy levels, 
                        poor immune function, and other problems, but overfeeding is far more common.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention estimates that <a href="https://www.petobesityprevention.org/2022" style="color: #3a86ff;">59% of dogs 
                        are overweight or obese</a>, which puts them at increased risk for health problems including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Joint disease and arthritis</li>
                        <li>Heart problems</li>
                        <li>Breathing difficulties</li>
                        <li>Heat exhaustion and heatstroke</li>
                        <li>Reduced quality of life</li>
                        <li>Skin problems</li>
                        <li>Urinary issues</li>
                        <li>Many forms of cancer</li>
                        <li>Shortened lifespan</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If your dog is overweight, an over-the-counter diet dog food such as 
                        <a href="https://www.chewy.com/purina-pro-plan-adult-weight/dp/52456" style="color: #3a86ff;">Purina Pro Plan Adult Weight Management Shredded Blend Chicken & Rice Formula</a>

                        Your veterinarian is your best partner in determining the right
                        feeding plan for your dog. They can assess your dog's body

                        dietary adjustments.

                    <p>

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <h3>How often should I feed my dog?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Generally, it is best to feed your dog twice a day, 
                        but how often to feed your dog varies based on your dog's age, 
                        breed, size, and any underlying medical conditions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>How many cups of food should I feed my dog each day?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Check the label on your dog's food for the feeding chart recommended by 
                        the pet food company for that specific dog food. You should also speak 
                        with your veterinarian about how much to feed your dog. Your veterinarian 
                        will make a specific nutrition plan considering your dog's age, size, 
                        body condition, activity level, and health status.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How do I know if I'm feeding my dog enough?</h3>
                    <p>
                        You'll know you're feeding your dog enough if they maintain a healthy weight 
                        with visible waistline, ribs that can be felt but not seen, steady energy, 
                        and firm stools. Use food label guidelines as a starting point, then adjust 
                        based on your veterinarian's advice.

                        <li>

            <h2>Understanding Your Dog's Nutritional Needs</h2>
            <p>Feeding the right amount of high-quality dog food is one of the simplest yet most important things you can do to keep your dog healthy. Too much food can lead to obesity, while too little can cause nutritional deficiencies.</p>
            <p>Every dog is unique, and their nutritional requirements depend on several factors that change throughout their lives.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="article-section">
            <h2>Factors That Affect Feeding Amount</h2>
            <h3>Age</h3>
            <p>Puppies need more calories and protein to support their rapid growth compared to adult dogs. Senior dogs often require fewer calories as their activity levels decrease.</p>
            
            <h3>Size and Weight</h3>
            <p>Larger dogs naturally need more food than smaller breeds. Use your dog's ideal weight, not their current weight, to determine portion sizes.</p>
            
            <h3>Activity Level</h3>
            <p>Active dogs that exercise regularly require more calories than sedentary pets. Working dogs or those in agility training need additional energy.</p>
            
            <h3>Health Status</h3>
            <p>Spayed or neutered dogs typically need fewer calories than unaltered dogs. Pregnant or nursing dogs require extra nutrition to support their puppies.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="article-section">
            <h2>General Feeding Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Most dogs should eat two meals per day, though this varies by size and age:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Puppies (under 4 months):</strong> 3-5 meals per day depending on breed size</li>
              <li><strong>Adult dogs:</strong> 2 meals per day</li>
              <li><strong>Senior dogs:</strong> 2 meals per day, possibly adjusted for lower activity</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section class="article-section">
            <h2>How to Determine the Right Amount</h2>
            <p>The best starting point is the feeding chart on your dog food package. These charts provide recommendations based on your dog's weight and the food's calorie content.</p>
            <p>Monitor your dog's body condition and adjust portions as needed. You should be able to feel (but not see) your dog's ribs, and they should have a visible waistline when viewed from above.</p>

          <section class="article-section">
            <h2>Why Proper Feeding Matters</h2>
            <p>Research shows that nearly 60% of dogs are overweight or obese, putting them at risk for serious health problems including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Joint disease and arthritis</li>
              <li>Heart problems</li>
              <li>Breathing difficulties</li>
              <li>Reduced quality of life</li>
              <li>Shortened lifespan</li>

            <h2>Working With Your Veterinarian</h2>
            <p>Your veterinarian is your best partner in determining the right feeding plan for your dog. They can assess your dog's body condition, discuss any health concerns, and recommend specific dietary adjustments.</p>
            <p>Schedule regular check-ups to monitor your dog's weight and overall health, making feeding adjustments as needed throughout their life.</p>

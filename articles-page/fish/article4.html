                        One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish… Dr. Seuss didn’t even scratch the surface of the variety
                        of fish this planet contains! In fact, it’s estimated that there are over 30,000 different
                        species of fish in the world, and they come in all different shapes and sizes. You’ll only see a
                        small percentage of these in your typical household aquarium, but it’s still no wonder keeping
                        an aquarium is a popular hobby. It’s even been shown to offer various health benefits, like
                        relieving stress and improving focus and creativity!

                        Fish species can be just as different as the colors of a rainbow, with their own unique needs and
                        personalities. Some are easygoing, beginner-friendly fish, while others can be high maintenance.
                        Some are territorial, and some love to mate. Before investing in an aquarium, take the time to
                        learn about some of the popular fish species and which ones best suit your lifestyle.

                    <h2>Freshwater fish vs. saltwater fish</h2>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="../../images/fish/how-to-care-for-fish-a-complete-guide-2.png" alt="fresh water fish vs saltwater fish"

                    <p>
                        The biggest difference between freshwater fish and saltwater fish is all in the name. Freshwater
                        fish are found in rivers and streams, while saltwater fish are found in the ocean. Except for a
                        few species, saltwater fish will die in freshwater, and vice versa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Freshwater fish tend to be a bit hardier than saltwater fish. The salinity levels of water in
                        rivers and ponds can change a lot compared to the ocean, so these fish can adapt to a wider
                        range of water parameters in a tank. Since they’re easier to take care of, some of the most
                        common fish you’ll see as pets are goldfish, guppies, beta fish, and neon tetras. Freshwater
                        aquatic plants such as Java Moss, Water Wisteria, African Water Fern, and Amazon Swords can
                        provide lush greenery in your tank.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Saltwater fish require more stable and specific water conditions, but your efforts will be
                        rewarded by their vibrant colors. A saltwater aquarium might look as colorful as a scene from
                        Finding Nemo, featuring the Blue Hippo Tang, the Clownfish, the Yellow Tang, and the Striped
                        Damselfish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Saltwater fish can also be more expensive than their freshwater friends. The cost of the
                        equipment and the price of the fish themselves can easily be twice as much. You can also
                        decorate your saltwater tank with different types of algae, colorful coral, and plants like
                        Mangroves, Turtle Grass Shoots, and Sea Lettuce. All of these living things have symbiotic
                        relationships with the fish in your tank and help create a happy balance.

                    <p>
                        There’s a lot you can do to watch the health of your fish. Keep an eye on them, and you’ll likely
                        notice if something seems a little off! Some signs of illness could include changes in their
                        swimming behavior, for example, loss of balance or buoyancy control, floating upside down, or
                        'sitting' on the tank floor. You may also notice some physical changes like changes in the color
                        or condition of the body and fins, lesions, or abdominal swelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most common reason that your fish could be sick is due to parasites, internally or
                        externally. They can also be afflicted with fungal, bacterial, or viral infections. Some of the
                        most common fish illnesses are Anchor Worms, Dropsy, Skin or Gill Flukes, and White Spots. These
                        can happen to any fish, whether salt or freshwater. Neon Tetras can sometimes get Neon Tetra
                        Disease, a parasite that will cause discoloration.

                        The best way to care for your fish’s health is to prevent illness in the first place! Some ways
                        you can do this include:

                    <p>
                        Part of the fun of having an aquarium is setting up the perfect little habitat for your new fish
                        friends. Before getting started, it’s important to consider how much time and money you want to
                        invest. Whether you opt for a basic freshwater setup or a state-of-the-art saltwater aquarium,
                        there’s always room for creativity.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How to choose the right fish tank</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just like the fish that live in them, aquariums come in all shapes and sizes. The first thing you
                        may want to consider is the size of the tank. This may be decided by your budget because a
                        larger tank requires a larger filter, a bigger heater, and more water conditioner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surprisingly, a bigger tank will be easier to care for. Waste like pee, poo, and uneaten food
                        will collect in the tank, and a larger tank will keep these toxins more diluted and need to be
                        cleaned less often. You’ll also need to factor in how much space you’ll need in the tank for
                        aquatic plants, gravel, and other decorative items.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The size of the tank you choose may also be affected by the space you choose for it. Remember
                        that a large take filled with water will be very heavy, so make sure the stand you have for it
                        can support the weight. You’ll likely want to keep the tank somewhere it can be seen and enjoyed
                        often and isn’t too hot or cold. Heating vents, fans, and windows can change the temperature of
                        the tank and put your fish under stress. Direct sunlight can also cause algae to grow faster, so
                        it's important to find the right location.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The size of the tank you choose will directly impact the species and the number of fish you can
                        place in this new home. Pet stores usually sell fish as babies, and they grow! One tried and
                        true rule is one gallon of water per one inch of fish. For example, a four-gallon tank should
                        suffice if you have two, two-inch-long fish. Do some research on the different species you want
                        to have and their adult sizes. Also note that just because a fish is small, it doesn’t
                        necessarily mean it needs less space because some fish are territorial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another consideration is whether to buy glass or acrylic. Most experts would recommend a glass
                        tank over an acrylic tank for anything under 150 gallons. This is because an acrylic tank can
                        scratch very easily, even from the gravel at the bottom. Glass tanks are also cheaper, and
                        easier to come by.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the end, you need to choose a tank that fits your home, fits your budget, and fits whatever
                        fish and plants you wish to put inside it. If you take the time to make those calculations,
                        you’re sure to create a happy little home!

                    <h2>Filtration</h2>
                    <div class="article-media">
                        <img src="../../images/fish/how-to-care-for-fish-a-complete-guide-5.png" alt="Filtration host of tank"

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The last thing you want is for your beautiful, clear aquarium to turn into a filthy swamp and a
                        source of guilt. This is where filtration comes in! Because fish produce waste, filtration is
                        essential. Filters move and clean the water, making it safe for fish to live in. The three main
                        types of filtration are mechanical, biological, and chemical filtration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A mechanical filter physically strains the debris out of the water using sponges, filter rocks,
                        and filter pads, kind of like a coffee filter. It collects the debris, and the pet-parent is
                        responsible for taking out the trash. This method keeps your water clearer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A biological filter is possibly the most interesting because this is where living microorganisms
                        come in. Certain beneficial bacteria will modify your fish’s waste into less harmful substances.
                        This is called the nitrogen cycle. Simply put, waste and uneaten food break down into ammonia,
                        which is toxic for fish. Beneficial bacteria can then turn ammonia into nitrates, which are less
                        harmful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nitrates can then be consumed by certain plants in your tank. For this to be effective, you need
                        to have enough surface area for beneficial bacteria to grow. Most filters come with biofilter
                        media which can facilitate the successful colonization of good bacteria in your aquarium by
                        increasing the available surface area. Biofiltration makes the water safer for your fish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chemical filtration uses activated carbon or special resins that can remove medications, tannins,
                        and other impurities from the water. Activated charcoal is the most popular chemical filtration
                        system because it can deal with a wide variety of pollutants and is readily available and
                        affordable. Chemical filtration is best saved for removing impurities from the water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a great filtration system, your fish will practically glow in the pristine water!

                        important to keep the water temperature just right. With no temperature-controlling mechanism
                        inside it, the fish tank will eventually cool down or warm up to room temperature. The water
                        temperature can also be affected by direct sunlight, a draft in the room, or aquarium lights,
                        how large the tank is, if the top is covered, and how much water movement there is.

                        Aquarium fish fall into two general categories: cool water and tropical. Cool water fish prefer
                        unheated aquariums usually between 60° and 75°F. For many tropical fish, a temperature of 78°F
                        is ideal. The exact temperature required for different species can vary, so be sure to do some
                        research.

                    <p>
                        The two main types of heaters are submersible heaters, which stay completely below the water, and
                        immersible heaters, which have a partially submerged glass tube containing the heating and
                        leaves the controls above the water. They come in a variety of sizes, and this should be
                        calculated based on the temperature of the room and the volume of water in the tank. The general
                        rule of thumb is 5 watts (W) of heat per 1 gallon of water. Don’t forget to add a thermometer to
                        your tank! This will give you peace of mind that your fish are comfortable.

                    <p>
                        Everyone knows the difference good lighting can make! Lighting in an aquarium serves two
                        purposes. It highlights and shows off your fish's colors and provides energy for your plants.
                        The type of lighting you choose can depend on your plant-to-fish ratio, but either way,
                        fluorescent lights are the way to go. Incandescent bulbs give off too much heat and require more
                        energy. Be aware that too much light and not enough plants will encourage algae growth.

                    <p>
                        Substrates are any loose material that makes up the bottom of your tank. They’re used for their
                        appealing aesthetic, to house the beneficial bacteria that take part in the nitrogen cycle (as
                        noted earlier), and for plants to grow roots in. The general recommendation is at least 3
                        inches, which is enough for plants to grow roots. Some common substrates are pebbles, gravel,
                        sand, or dirt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pebbles can be comprised of river rock, quartz, glass, and even colored plastic that glows in the
                        dark. The downside to pebbles is that they’re usually larger, and can leave open gaps for
                        uneaten food and poop to build-up. Gravel is basically the same as pebbles, but smaller, so it’s
                        a little easier to clean and manage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sand is probably the easiest substrate to keep clean because there’s nowhere for uneaten food and
                        poop to get stuck. It’s also available in a range of grain sizes, from coarse to fine, and a
                        wide range of colors. Soil can be a good substrate for the plants in your aquarium, but if
                        you’re not careful, you’ll end up with muddy water. Fortunately, you can buy substrate soil that
                        is specially formulated to prevent it from mixing with water while also providing nutrients for
                        your plants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may be tempted to use things from your garden to cover your aquarium floor, but this could
                        introduce bacteria, dust, chemicals, and other bad things that could harm your fish. It’s best
                        to only use store-bought substrates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Decoration things like real driftwood and coral could add diseases or parasites to your tank, so
                        always purchase items that have been sterilized and are safe to add to the tank. You’ll also
                        want to avoid anything that could leak chemicals into your tank, like paint, copper, or
                        concrete. Avoid sharp objects as well. Whatever you decide to add to your tank, be sure to give
                        it a good rinse first.

                        Plants are for more than just the great looks. They have a symbiotic relationship with fish and
                        serve multiple purposes. Whether you opt for real plants or plastic, they provide places for
                        your fish to hide and chase their fishy friends around.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Plastic plants are much easier to maintain, but real aquatic plants have their own benefits. They
                        can help filter out nitrates and other chemical waste products, as well as ​​create more
                        breathable oxygen for your fish. Live plants also have their own unique needs, so you’ll need to
                        put as much thought into choosing them as you did for your fish.

                    <h2>Cleaning the tank and changing the water</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your filtration system definitely helps keep your water safe and clean, but it won’t do all the
                        heavy lifting. You’ll still need to clean the tank and change the water regularly. How often you
                        need to do this depends greatly on the type of tank and the fish in it. Some recommend doing a
                        cleaning once every week or two, but there’s no hard rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For most average-sized tanks, a weekly water change can be extremely beneficial to the health and
                        well-being of your fish. It may seem overwhelming, but it’s actually pretty simple! To do this
                        you should remove about one-quarter of the water in the tank, and replace it with treated water.
                        At this time, you can also use a clean face cloth to wipe the algae off the glass and other
                        decorative items, use an aquarium vacuum to give the gravel a good clean, and check that the
                        filter is working correctly. Once a month, you should check the levels of ammonia, nitrate, and
                        pH levels within your tank, and clean out your filter cartridges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should avoid removing fish from the tank as much as possible, and only do it for a deep clean
                        every few months. Choose a container that’s deep enough that your fish won’t jump out, and rinse
                        it with water. Transfer water directly from the aquarium to the rinsed container, as this will
                        help prevent your fish from going into shock. Gently scoop the fish out one at a time with a
                        net, submerge it into the water and let the fish swim out on their own. Once the tank is clean,
                        gently net the fish and put them back into the aquarium one at a time.

                        type and nutritional content, with options ranging from floating flakes for smaller fish to
                        sinking pellets and wafers ideal for bottom feeders.

                    <p>
                        We all remember the line “fish are friends, not food!” from Finding Nemo. In reality, most fish
                        eat other fish. Protein is the essential nutrient in the fish diet, and fish is the best protein
                        source for them. Select a food that has the first few ingredients listed as fish meal, shrimp,
                        and other seafood on the label. Most fish are omnivorous, but some can be herbivores or
                        carnivores. You’ll need to select a food that is specific to their needs. Herbivores and
                        omnivores need between 35-45% protein in their food. Carnivores need 40-55%. If the label shows
                        additional protein supplements or multiple protein sources, this could mean a poor source of
                        protein and a bad diet for your fish. Pacus, Silver Dollars, Farowellas, and Mollies are
                        primarily vegetarian fishes. Most fish will benefit from some vegetation, like algae flakes, in
                        their diet unless they’re fully carnivorous like piranhas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just like humans, fish also require fat in their diet for energy, insulation, and hormone
                        production. In most fish, fats should be 15-25% of the total diet. Fish don't need many
                        carbohydrates in their diet, so avoid foods with a large number of grains, or grains listed as
                        the first ingredients. Fish also need to get most of their vitamins from their diet, like
                        vitamins A, C, D, E & K. Vitamin A. Be sure to check the label for a good mix of vitamins.

                    <p>
                        The environment in which we keep our pets has a large impact on their emotional state, and fish
                        are no different. In an aquarium, pet parents can provide opportunities for fish to engage in
                        their natural behaviors like foraging for food, playing, exploring, and socially communicating.
                        It’s important to consider the species for this as well, because some fish may prefer to hide,
                        whereas others may prefer to swim in a current of water.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To ensure there is enough structural enrichment to keep all the fish happy, a good rule of thumb
                        is to keep approximately 50% of the tank floor covered. If there aren’t enough spaces to hide,
                        some territorial fish may become aggressive. Try swapping out the decor once in a while to keep
                        things novel, or placing a mirror outside the tank.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We all know that fish sense vibrations in the water. Sudden noises like slamming doors or barking
                        can stress them out. It’s good to avoid music with a lot of bass, but classical music could be
                        beneficial to fish, as the background noise of the music drowns out any sudden noises.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Carefully selecting species to place together in an aquarium can be socially enriching for some
                        species of fish. For species that group together, like neon tetras, white cloud mountain
                        minnows, and zebrafish, it can be distressing for them to be alone. Giving your fish some
                        friends is enriching for them, and entertaining for you too!

                        Now that you have your new fish friends all set up in their new home, it’s only natural to want
                        to interact with them. It may seem fun to stick your hand right into the tank and see if you can
                        touch them, but is this a good idea? Do fish like being handled or pet?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fish are delicate creatures, and you should only handle them in an emergency or if they need to
                        be moved to a different tank. Even the toughest fish can suffer permanent damage to their fins
                        and gills if they’re handled improperly. They’re covered in a slime coat that acts as a barrier
                        from bacteria and impurities in the water, and if the slime is rubbed off, they can lose their
                        protection against infections and diseases. Fish could also become stressed from your movement
                        and perceive it as an attack. If you absolutely need to transport your fish into another tank,
                        gently scoop them out of the water using a net.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are ways to interact with your fish safely. Using your finger or a brightly colored stick
                        to attract their attention, trace the outside of the tank until they start to follow you. You
                        can even use this to teach them to swim through a hoop for a cute little trick!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fish like betas and goldfish can be taught to jump out of the water. Wet your finger or a stick
                        and put a piece of food on the end of it. Hold it just above the water until your fish notices
                        and makes a jump for it. You can raise your finger a little higher to make it challenging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tapping on the tank and touching your fish can be harmful and scary for them. It could
                        permanently damage them or negatively impact their health. Watching and safely interacting with
                        fish is proven to have positive effects on your state of mind and mental well-being, be a good
                        friend and keep it healthy for them too!

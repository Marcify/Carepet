                       Persian cats have a lifespan averaging 10–13 years. Because they are prone to certain health conditions, it may be beneficial to purchase pet insurance for your Persian kitten.

                    <h2>Hydrocephalus</h2>
                    <p>
                        Persian kittens with extreme brachycephaly are at a higher risk of developing <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_hydrocephalus" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">hydrocephalus</a>, an abnormal expansion and accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the cavities of the brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Signs of congenital hydrocephalus typically appear within the first few weeks to a year after birth and include seizures, a dome-shaped head, abnormal breathing, and failure to thrive. Cats with hydrocephalus may require surgery.

                    <h2>Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome</h2>
                    <p>
                       <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_brachycephalic_airway_syndrome" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">Brachycephalic airway syndrome</a> is a group of upper airway issues often seen in flat-faced cats and dogs. Brachycephalic breeds often have trouble breathing due to physical traits such as narrowed nostrils, an elongated soft palate, or larynx (voice box) collapse. An abnormally small trachea may also cause breathing difficulties. This condition can limit a Persian's ability to exercise and tolerate heat, particularly in <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/nutrition/evr_multi_is_my_cat_fat_overweight" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">overweight cats</a>, senior cats, or <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/systemic/allergies-cats" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">cats with allergies.</a>

                    <p>
                        If you ever notice your <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/symptoms/cat-panting-why-it-happens-and-what-do-about-it" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">cat breathing with an open mouth</a>, this is a medical emergency and they should see their vet right away.

                    <h2>Skin and Coat Disorders</h2>
                    <p>
                       Persians have abnormally long fur due to a genetic mutation that interferes with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49317-4" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">hair protein function</a>. This makes them more prone to coat and skin issues, such as <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/skin-fungal-infections-cats" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">fungal</a> and <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_pyoderma" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">bacterial skin infections.</a>

                    <h2>Polycystic Kidney Disease</h2>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_congenital_developmental_renal_diseases" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)</a> is a genetic condition that causes cysts to form in the kidneys, resulting in permanent damage. Kidney damage impairs waste filtration, fluid balance, and proper hormone production. Fortunately, genetic testing can help prevent the disease in kittens by identifying carriers, so ask your Persian breeder about the breeding parents' test results. At-home DNA kits can also detect PKD in cats before symptoms appear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Symptoms of PKD are very similar to those of <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/kidney-disease-cats" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">kidney disease in cats</a> and can be evident as early as 6 months of age, but usually appear around 7 years of age. If you notice your cat drinking more water, urinating more frequently, not eating well, or losing weight, they should have a checkup with their vet as soon as possible.

                    <h2>Progressive Retinal Atrophy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Persian cats may be prone to <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_retinal_degeneration" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">progressive retinal atrophy (PRA)</a>, where the eye’s retina degenerates. Symptoms gradually worsen over time. Night blindness is typically the first sign of PRA and can appear in young cats around 1–2 years of age. Ultimately, the condition leads to total blindness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no cure for PRA, but cats without sight can still have a high-quality life with some extra care. When working with a responsible breeder, ask about your Persian kitten’s parents' genetic test results.

                    <p>
                        While all cats are at risk of dental disease, Persian cats may be at an increased risk due to their flat face, which can cause their teeth to be overcrowded. <a href="https://www.petmd.com/news/view/how-often-should-you-brush-dog-teeth-and-cat-teeth-37925" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">Brushing your cat's teeth daily</a> and scheduling regular veterinary check-ups and dental cleanings are the most effective methods of <a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/dental-issues-cats" target="_blank" style="color: #3a86ff;">preventing dental issues.</a>

                        The average Chihuahua lifespan is 14-16 years; they're actually one of the 
                        longest-living dog breeds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with of their long lifespan, Chihuahuas are generally healthy. 
                        But, like all dogs, they are predisposed to certain medical conditions.

                    <h2>Obesity</h2>

                    <p>
                        Weight gain can sometimes be difficult to notice, especially in long-haired Chihuahuas. 
                        The gain is usually due to poor diet and lack of exercise. Obesity in dogs can lead 
                        to diabetes, joint issues, and heart and respiratory disease.

                    <h2>Luxating Patellas</h2>

                    <p>
                        Patellar luxation is a condition where the kneecap slips out of its normal position, 
                        causing discomfort, limping, and arthritis if it becomes a chronic issue. These dogs 
                        will be seen occasionally skipping and holding up a back leg while walking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often, the patella returns back to the correct position on its own or with a gentle massage 
                        of the area. Surgery is recommended in severe cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An appropriate diet to avoid weight gain, regular exercise, joint supplements, and 
                        physical therapy can be helpful to prevent this condition from worsening.

                    <h2>Periodontal Disease</h2>

                    <p>
                        Periodontal disease, or dental disease, is commonly seen in Chihuahuas because it's 
                        easy for teeth to overcrowd their small mouths. This overcrowding leads to tartar 
                        build-up and plaque development.  On top of that, many Chihuahuas retain their baby 
                        teeth, crowding the mouth even further.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Routine teeth brushing, dental cleanings, and surgical removal of any lingering baby 
                        teeth will help keep your Chi's mouth healthy.

                    <h2>Collapsing Trachea</h2>

                    <p>
                        Collapsing trachea is a condition where the main airway (the trachea) 
                        that allows air to enter and exit the lungs begins to collapse on itself. 
                        It's secondary to weakness in the cartilage that normally holds this tube open, 
                        and it's believed that genetics are the main cause.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coughing (often described as “goose-honking”), wheezing, and respiratory distress 
                        are the main clinical signs. It is a chronic and progressive process, which 
                        means the signs will worsen with age. Mild cases often require no treatment, 
                        while moderate to severe cases require weight management, lessening allergens 
                        in the environment, and cough suppressants. If all other remedies fail, surgery 
                        might be recommended.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To protect their trachea, pet parents should walk their Chihuahua on a harness 
                        instead of clipping a leash to their collar.

                    <h2>Heart Disease</h2>

                    <p>
                        Congestive heart failure is the leading cause of death in older Chihuahuas and 
                        most often related to chronic degenerative mitral valve disease. This specific 
                        condition weakens the valve on the left side of the heart, causing blood to leak 
                        backward. This eventually leads to heart enlargement, increased stress on the 
                        heart, and congestive heart failure. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chihuahuas are also prone to congenital heart issues such as patent ductus arteriosus 
                        (PDA), where a blood-carrying vessel doesn't close after birth, leading to an overload 
                        of blood being carried to the lungs. Clinical signs of heart disease include:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Coughing</li>
                            <li>Exercise intolerance</li>
                            <li>Weakness</li>
                            <li>Collapse</li>
                            <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often, your veterinarian will hear a heart murmur during an examination, 
                        which can be the first indicator of underlying heart disease. PDAs require 
                        surgery for appropriate therapy. Chronic degenerative valve disease is, 
                        unfortunately, a progressive process that can require lifelong heart 
                        medications and frequent monitoring by a cardiologist.

                    <p>
                        Hydrocephalus is a congenital abnormality where fluid accumulates within 
                        the brain. Clinical signs include seizures, confusion, bulging eyes, 
                        weakness, and ataxia (a “drunken” gait). Mild cases are often medically 
                        managed, while severe cases may require surgery.

                    <h2>Eye Problems</h2>

                    <p>
                        Part of the Chihuahua's appeal is their extra-large, expressive eyes. 
                        But they can inherit a handful of eye conditions, including glaucoma, 
                        chronic dry eye, and cataracts. Clinical signs of these conditions include:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Red eyes</li>
                            <li>Bulging eyes</li>
                            <li>Eye discharge</li>
                            <li>Rubbing at the eyes due to pain</li>
                            <li>Blindness</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eye conditions can be quite painful, so it's important to see a veterinarian 
                        if you have any concerns about your Chihuahua's eyes.

                    <h2>Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease</h2>

                    <p>
                        Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is a degenerative hip condition found in Chihuahua puppies, 
                        typically between the ages of 6-9 months. It's thought to be caused by decreased bloody 
                        supply to the hip and is characterized by the ball of the hip bone starting to die off, 
                        leading to pain and fracture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The condition can be remedied with surgery to remove the ball of the femur bone, 
                        which will decrease pain and improve your pet's quality of life.

                        Chihuahuas have a large, domed skull and a small body—including a small pelvis. 
                        Therefore, it can be difficult for females to pass the large heads of Chihuahua 
                        puppies through their birthing canals. C-sections are sometimes necessary and 
                        are often performed with planned pregnancies for this breed.

                    <p>
                        Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a condition seen often in this breed due to 
                        the dogs' small size. Most often seen in young Chihuahuas, it's often managed 
                        with appropriate diet and frequent feedings. Clinical signs include severe 
                        lethargy, decreased appetite, weakness, collapse, or seizures. Severe cases 
                        require hospitalization on intravenous fluid therapy with sugar supplementation.

                        <li>
                            Chihuahuas have an impressive 14-16 year lifespan and are generally healthy, but like all breeds, 
                            they are predisposed to specific health conditions that owners should monitor throughout their lives.

                        <li>
                            Obesity is common in Chihuahuas and can be difficult to spot in long-haired varieties, leading to 
                            serious complications including diabetes, joint problems, and heart disease if not managed with proper diet and exercise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Small mouth structure makes Chihuahuas particularly prone to periodontal disease due to overcrowding teeth 
                            and retained baby teeth, requiring routine brushing, professional cleanings, and potential tooth extractions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Heart disease, especially chronic degenerative mitral valve disease, is the leading cause of death in older 
                            Chihuahuas and may require lifelong medications and monitoring by a cardiologist.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Their small size and unique anatomy predispose Chihuahuas to multiple conditions including luxating patellas, 
                            collapsing trachea, eye problems, hypoglycemia, and reproductive difficulties requiring C-sections for safe breeding.

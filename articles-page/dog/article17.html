                        Shih Tzu are minimal shedders, but don't confuse that with having minimal grooming needs. 
                        Their coat—which can be a variety of colors including black, white, and red—grows 
                        continuously and needs to be trimmed and brushed regularly.

                    <h2>Skin Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        Because their coats grow long, making them prone to matting and skin irritation, 
                        Shih Tzu dogs need a bath once a week. Contact your veterinarian if you notice 
                        any changes in your dog's skin, including redness, flakiness, or dryness.

                    <h2>Coat Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        Along with bathing, Shih Tzu must be brushed at least a few times each week, 
                        but preferably daily. Use a pin brush or a comb.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Routine professional grooming should be part of your budget, to either 
                        maintain the long hair coat or to shave it into a cute Shih Tzu haircut periodically. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Eye Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        A Shih Tzu needs the hair around their eyes trimmed or pulled up with a hair tie to 
                        avoid any eye irritation. Their big eyes can easily become inflamed if hair is 
                        allowed to rub against them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Shih Tzu is a breed that can be prone to tear staining because of their flat face. 
                        Excessive tear production or blocked tear ducts lead to a buildup of a reddish-brown 
                        pigment at the inner corners of the eyes, often extending toward the muzzle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keeping this area clean and dry is the best way to avoid staining. Use a vet-recommended 
                        tear stain remover.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If staining is excessive or if your dog's eyes are red, swollen, or painful, 
                        contact your veterinarian.

                    <h2>Ear Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        Shih Tzu dogs are prone to ear infections due to hair growing inside their ear canals. 
                        This hair holds onto moisture, which can cause inflammation and infection by bacteria, 
                        fungus, or both. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Routine cleaning with a vet-approved ear cleaner will help reduce the chances of ear 
                        infections. If excessive hair is noted inside the ear canals, your veterinarian or 
                        groomer may recommend removing it to avoid irritation.

                    <h2>Dental Care</h2>

                    <p>
                        It's important to brush your Shih Tzu's teeth every day with a dog-safe toothpaste and brush.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep up with regular veterinary appointments so your vet can monitor your dog's mouth and 
                        recommend professional cleanings under anesthesia when necessary.

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <ul class="key-points">
                        <li>
                            Shih Tzu are minimal shedders but have extensive grooming needs because their continuously growing coat 
                            requires regular trimming and brushing to prevent matting and maintain their appearance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Weekly baths are essential for Shih Tzu due to their long coats that are prone to matting and skin irritation, 
                            with any skin changes requiring immediate veterinary attention.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Daily brushing with a pin brush or comb is ideal (minimum several times weekly), combined with routine 
                            professional grooming to maintain long coats or create periodic stylish Shih Tzu haircuts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Eye care is critical for Shih Tzu—hair around eyes must be trimmed or tied up to prevent irritation, and 
                            their flat faces make them prone to tear staining requiring regular cleaning with vet-recommended removers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Daily teeth brushing is essential due to dental disease risks, while routine ear cleaning prevents infections 
                            caused by hair growing inside ear canals that traps moisture and promotes bacterial or fungal growth.
                        </li>
